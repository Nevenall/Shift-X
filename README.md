Shift-X is a superheroic roleplaying game Forged in the Dark. It is about a team of people with extraordinary powers trying to create and deepen their relationships while foiling the plans of devious villains.  

## Touchstones

The Marvel Cinematic Universe, especially the Avengers movies, are the Platonic ideal for the Shift-X experience.
