## Shift-X Outline

have some ideas about the outline, I want to see the core structure of game play, the event: action sequence, transitions, action sequence. Downtime. Structure present in the general outline, so you can easily find the reference you want for the phase you happened to be within. 

there is still intro material though. Characters and sheets and how to roll stuff. Clocks, and threat levels. Stress and trauma. 

1. basics
1. characters
  1. threat level
  1. powers
  1. background & origins
  1. nemesis
  1. relationships
1. teams
1. events <!-- what is the structure of an event?  -->
  1. incitement
  1. action sequences <!--how much can we flex what an action sequence is? Can we think of the final scene in Jessica jones as an action sequence? It would be cool if we could.-->
  1. transitions
    1. stress relief
    1. resource acquisition
    1. gathering information/tracing
  1. resolution <!-- A scene/sequence where the stakes are the highest -->
1. downtime


That's pretty good. 

## setting specificity 

the srd is pretty generic in it's examples, especially at first. the question is how much of the Shift-X superhero setting should we make a part of the manuscript? I feel like it's the most interesting to put in lots of the setting, but then again, it's not to everyone's taste. It's very much the apocalypse world thing. we'll not quite. some people just didn't like the voice of the book, not the setting details, as such. 
I'm an, embrace the voice of the setting, kind of guy. What other way is there to be really?

So, shift-x details and characters abound. Of course, shift-x is not even close to entirely my creation. Which brings up...other thoughts about the setting. mmm...well, it's a thing I should talk about with the other dudes if I'm going to license their characters under Creative Commons.  


Do we need more info about using powers? Does that belong under the action roll section?
