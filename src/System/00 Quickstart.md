# Quickstart

For players already familiar with *Blades in the Dark*, this quickstart summarizes how *Shift-X* is different.

## Structure of a Game

A *Shift-X* session may start with downtime activities and free play just like a *Blades* game, but rather than the crew picking a score and making an engagement roll, the GM will pick a moment to interrupt the heroes' lives with a villain's evil plans. 

### Action Sequences

The central unit of cinematic play in *Shift-X* is the action sequence. It's one, or more, scenes of action and conflict where the heroes attempt to interfere with some part of the villain's plan.

An action sequence kicks off with the GM making an engagement roll on behalf of the villain to see how well this stage of their plan is going when the action starts. Do the heroes arrive just in the nick of time? (**4/5**), or do they get the drop on the unfortunate mastermind (**1-3**)?

GM Note: It's best to make the engagement roll early, even before the transition activities are done because the engagement roll can have strong affect on the next action sequence. It could make the different between fighting an army of the villain's minions or ambushing the villain alone. 

Thwarting a villain involves an escalating series of action sequences connected by a transition period where heroes can risk taking time to gather info or recover stress before the next action sequence. 

### Transition Activities

Between action sequences is a period of transition where heroes often travel to new locations and have the chance to do things like recover stress or gather information. However, the more transition activities the team pursues, the more dice the GM will add to the villain's next engagement roll. This is the driving tension of *Shift-X* and is quite different from the slowly building tension of *Blades in the Dark*.

## Powers

section for powers and powersets, their basic structure. Name, threat, description. Limits. 

A bit about how you use powers and what might happen when you do.

### SFX 

By default powers have limitations, but special effects

### Stunts

Heroes have a whole extra way to push themselves and that is with stunts. Stunts are basically any way of using your powerset that it doesn't currently allow, but fits narratively. This could be adding a new power temporarily, or changing how an existing power works. Stunts typically last for a scene. Which may, or may not, correspond to a current action sequence.  

## Into the Action

This is a section for taking actions and how powers affect that, and also additional complications that can occur, namely, adding engagement dice. And powers getting overtaxed or shutdown. 

Also want to know about the GM spending villainy dice for things like villain "flashbacks" and contingency plans, and also to escape.  

## Transitions

common transition activities. Healing rolls, relationship rolls, gather info. Other stuff, gathering new resources. 

## Making Heroes

7 action dots. Max 2 to start. 
7 threat of powers. Max 3.
1 Ability.
3 dots of relationships, 1 must be an NPC. Also they are symmetric, so if you choose someone and they also choose you, you both get a 2. 

Writing powers. 

### Types

List of powers and specific info about them.

CUrrent power categories are more abstract than these. That could be kinda an issue for somethings because you get caught up in what is the right way to describe a power discussions. Also, what about sfx? there is some room for them, maybe. Like, add an extra option, I think I did that for the Powerfist. The fist works for fight or wreck, which makes sense, but here is the thing... does it make any sense to limit powers to a specific action? or a specific attrribute for that matter? 
DOes that break the fiction-first nature of the game? I think so. 
Which means, some powers you can obviously use for fighting and wrecking, or fighting and move like iron man's repulsors. You just have to accept any consequences you might run into. 
Which is fine, means we have to describe powers well. 

for example, it just makes sense that you could roll acrobatics when using a move power based on swinging. 


So, here is another issue from iron man, what about the giant chest beam, the attack power you only use once. or so, is that a stunt? similar question, why ever take more than one attack power? If you break it down, do superheroes ever really have more than one attack power? or are their attacks just some flavor of the same powers? And, if someone did take two attack powers...what 

-->

#### Attack

Attack powers represent some kind of attack a character can make either ranged or close quarters.  
It can be a physical attack, which is the most common. Physical attacks increase the effect of an action, usually a Fight action and, depending on the description of the power, might lend their effect to Wreck as well. 

Pick an action and 
<!-- Default is Fight only, there is a special effect for Wreck AND Fight. Are there some attacks that are directed by other actions? Like is there a power that adds its effect to a Spy action? like a secret device? Also, for an sfx you get potency against groups. Which means something like, no reduced effect against a group for AOE  
Or is is flexible like control is. Apply your threat against the magnitude tables when you need to fight multiple targets. 
-->

Attacks can also be psychic in nature and lend their effect to, most commonly, a Menace action. 

#### Defense

Defense powers are very common. They provide a hero the ability to resist even fatal consequences. When you take a defense power, pick an attribute and a common type of damage or consequence you can resist. When you resist a consequence without a power you normally reduce it's severity by 1, but when you use a power to resist a consequence you can reduce it by 1+(threat of your defense power). this makes it more common for you to entirely avoid consequences. 

Also, when you use a defense power you might avoid the consequence entirely but trade it in for a suitably reduced consequence of a very different type based upon the limits of your powerset.

Some resist powers grant you the ability to resist consequences with a different attribute.

Some common examples:
> Body Armor - resists physical attacks with Prowess. notably small arms, punches, and perhaps lasers. Doesn't usually work as well more elemental attacks like fire, lightning, poison and such.
> Toughness - Like armor but your body is especially resilient. Resist physical consequences with Prowess. Also not generally as good against elemental harm.
> Force Field - You can create force fields from your will. Resist physical consequences with Resolve. You have to be aware of the harm to use this power.  
> Resist Fire - You can resist harm from fire and heat with Prowess. So, for more limited powers like this, do you get increased effect. You can 
> Precognition - If you are aware of a physical consequence you can resist it with Insight.
> Reflexes - You can dodge lots of consequences with your amazing reflexes. You have to be aware of the consequence. 

#### Resist

Resist powers work against a specific uncommon kind of consequence. Such as heat and fire, or cold, or psychic attacks, or being conned or lied to. Because these powers are generally less applicable, they reduce the severity of consequences by the power's threat BEFORE you need to roll to resist. In this way a resist power allows you to ignore consequences that do not exceed your threat. If a consequence is greater then your power you resist the overage normally if you wish.

Question is, can you take a power that resists physical attacks? Like, lasers, or hand to hand attacks? 

> Born on a Fire Planet - Reduce incoming heat and fire-based consequences. 
> Iron Shirt - By focusing your chi you can reduce the level incoming hand to hand attacks. 

#### Movement

Movement powers grant a character either new forms of movement such as flying or swinging, or increased effect for an existing form of movement such as superhuman running. Movement powers generally use a Move action, but can optionally use another action such as Acrobatics.



#### Gather Information

There's a vast array of sensory and knowledge powers who's primary purpose is to provide new and unique ways to gather information. Pick one action this power works with. 

#### Control

Control grants influence over some narrative element. You can "spend" your threat on the magnitude table to assemble the effect of your power. You can spend stress to make up the different if you effect is larger than the threat of your power. 



<!-- So, 1 ability is pretty close to 1 threat worth of powers, so possibly, you could trade 1 threat worth of powers for another ability. Or vice versa?  -->

## dev notes about powers

I'm currently working though the characters again after the first time adding them to roll20, and I'm wondering where I want to place the divider between narrative and mechnically. I recently thought I probably don't want to specific an action that you use your power with. Narratively, if your power can apply to an action than it does otherwise not. 

So, I do no like worlds in peril powers because they don't mean a damned thing. I like the balance of MSH, but...it's still in the air how well that fits into blades. 

A power grants inceased effect. Powers should be narrative. Like, reflexes not defense. Because enhanced reflexes can apply to lots of actions like, acrobatics, maybe even fighting, but just like actions in blades, the gm says if your power has reduced effect in a given circumstance. So, if you are using enhanced reflexes to fight an armored robot, than the gm is with their right to say that you can do, but besides your effect being reduced by the robot's armor, your reflexes effect will also suffer reduced effect because this is not a clumsy robot. 

So, that's the value of multiple powersets because you can, by default, use one power from each powerset for an action, where appropriate. 

Reduced effect for powers might sometimes mean several levels of reduction. 

Can you include an extra power from a powerset with stress? Think about that. 

Stunts - When you create a stunt, you add a power to a powerset for a scene by spending stress of 1 + threat of the stunt? or just equal to threat.  

I like the distinction between defenses and resist. not sure how to codify that in this world. 

Could be resists are additive. Meaning that they are almost always applicable against the thing they resist against. So you have durability and fire resist you can almost always add both against fire attacks. mmm...that might fiddle with the default one power per set. But seems like a good pay off for investing in resists. 

Which raises the question, what if you have attack and reflexes? can you use all of them for a fight action? does this mean every action is an "add all your powers together" kind of thing? 
Pick your highest power, invest 1 stress to add your second highest power? that seems reasonbale especailly because it means you are risking consequences because you still have to roll your action no matter how much power you migth add to something. yuss.

Special Effects - Anything that fiddles with the threat levels of your powers is a great candidate for a special effect. 


## Powers Revised

lets take a shot at cortex powers in shift-x. It's almost a direct translation. 
actions and reactions become actions and resists.

the 1 to 4 scale translates pretty well though I think the shift-x scale might got a ways beyond 4. Maybe we can talk about what the scale for various powers might be. 

Recovering Shutdown powers: Wait for a transition scene, may or may not cost. Take an appropriate action to recover during an action sequence. Might be able to recover if you crit on an action.

### Attack

Blasts, claws, weapons, punches.

### Durability

### Elemental Control

### Intangibility

### Invisibility

### Movement

### Psychic 

These are a more interesting category, There's mind control and telepathy. Both have their scales and their effects. In C+ they are used to create complications. 

### Reflexes

Simlar to movement powers but not quite the same. Very come and can be used for actions or resistance. But obviously you have to be able to see it coming. 

Maybe change acrobatics back to Finesse? 

### Resistance

You are resistant to some kind of harm most people are normally not. Mystic or Psychic. Mmm...

### Senses

Tons of different possibilities here. Can help with actions, resists or gather info. 

### Shapeshifting

Also generally useful. 

### Size Changing

Grow or shrink, tend to come associated with other powers and some specific limits 

### Sorcery

Or cosmic force, not sure exactly about this one yet.

### Stamina

in c+ this one is mostly about recovery. Or resisting toxins and diseases and such. Totally can serve the same purpose 

### Strength 

Good one for actions, specially wreak. 

### Stretching

mmmm...stretching. So, this could be 

### Teleport

Bamf!

### Transmutation

I guess it's a thing

## Special Effects (sfx)

Things that can increase or decrease the threat of powers is commonly a sfx.

### Absorption 

When you resist a [type of attack] you can create a stunt using the avoided consequence or add it equally to all the powers in your set, for the rest of scene. 

### Afflict 

Increased effect when you inflict [type of consequence]. Maybe also add +1d?

### Area of Effect

Either you have increased effect on the magnitude table for size, or just your powers have AOE. Collateral damage can be a thing with these powers though. 

### Berserk

Add a die to the villainy pool for +1 effect. 

### Boost

Shutdown a power and increase the threat of another by +1. 

### Burst

Add +1d against a single target but with reduced effect.

### Constructs

Increased effect for stunts. 

### Counterattack

When you resist stuff, you can turn it into an attack. 

### Dangerous

Move your action towards desparate for increased effect.

### Focus 

a thing?

### Healing

+1d to treatment rolls for [type of harm].

### Immunity

Spend 1 stress to avoid [type of consequence].

### Multipower

Include more than one power from the same set in an action at -1 threat to each.

### Second Chance

spend 1 stress to reroll an action?

### Second Wind 

mmmm

### Unleashed

Inflict a consequence and increase the threat of a power by the same.

## Limits

Every powerset has at least one.

### Conscious Activation

Shutdown powerset when you are not conscious, or at 3 harm. 

### Exhausted

So what if instead of getting a PP you can shutdown a power like armor?

### Gear

Shutdown a power for an armor effect. Recover by taking an action or transition scene.
