# Quickstart

For players already familar with *Blades in the Dark*, this quickstart summerizes how *Shift-X* is different.

## Structure of a Game

A *Shift-X* session may start with downtime activities and free play just like a *Blades* game, but rather than the crew picking a score and making an engagement roll, the GM will pick a moment to interrupt the heroes's lives with some villain's evil plans. 

### Action Sequences

The central unit of cinematic play in *Shift-X* is the action sequence. 
<!-- need to describe an action sequence a little more. espeically how it represents some part of the villain's plan. -->
Thwarting a villain involves an escalating series of action sequences connected by a transition period where heroes can risk taking time to gather info or recover stress before the next action sequence.

<!-- Default is Fight only, there is a special effect for Wreck AND Fight. Are there some attacks that are directed by other actions? Like is there a power that adds its effect to a Spy action? like a secret device? Also, for an sfx you get potency against groups. Which means something like, no reduced effect against a group for AOE -->

Attacks can also be psychic in nature and lend their effect to, most commonly, a Menace action. 

### Defense

For a defense power, pick an attribute and a general kind of consequence that it will lend it's threat against those. Defenses can be armor, reflexes, predictive insight. Generally, a defense will only apply to a particular attribute.  

### Movement

Movement powers grant a character either new forms of movement such as flying or swinging, or increased effect for an existing form of movement such as superhuman running. Movement powers generally use a Move action, but can optionally use another action such as Acrobatics.
