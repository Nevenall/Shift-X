# Quickstart

For players already familiar with *Blades in the Dark*, this quickstart summarizes how *Shift-X* is different.

## Structure of a Game

A *Shift-X* session may start with downtime activities and free play just like a *Blades* game, but rather than the crew picking a score and making an engagement roll, the GM will pick a moment to interrupt the heroes' lives with a villain's evil plans. 

### Action Sequences

The central unit of cinematic play in *Shift-X* is the action sequence. It's one, or more, scenes of action and conflict where the heroes attempt to interfere with some part of the villain's plan.

An action sequence kicks off with the GM making an engagement roll on behalf of the villain to see how well this stage of their plan is going when the action starts. Do the heroes arrive just in the nick of time? (**4/5**), or do they get the drop on the unfortunate mastermind (**1-3**)?

GM Note: It's best to make the engagement roll early, even before the transition activities are done because the engagement roll can have strong affect on the next action sequence. It could make the different between fighting an army of the villain's minions or ambushing the villain alone. 

Thwarting a villain involves an escalating series of action sequences connected by a transition period where heroes can risk taking time to gather info or recover stress before the next action sequence. 

### Transition Activities

Between action sequences is a period of transition where heroes often travel to new locations and have the chance to do things like recover stress or gather information. However, the more transition activities the team pursues, the more dice the GM will add to the villain's next engagement roll. This is the driving tension of *Shift-X* and is quite different from the slowly building tension of *Blades in the Dark*.

## Powers

section for powers and powersets, their basic structure. Name, threat, description. Limits. 

A bit about how you use powers and what might happen when you do.

### Stunts

Heroes have a whole extra way to push themselves and that is with stunts. Stunts are basically any way of using your powerset that it doesn't currently allow, but fits narratively. This could be adding a new power temporarily, or changing how an existing power works. Stunts typically last for a scene. Which may, or may not, correspond to a current action sequence.  

## Into the Action

This is a section for taking actions and how powers affect that, and also additional complications that can occur, namely, adding engagement dice. And powers getting overtaxed or shutdown. 

Also want to know about the GM spending villainy dice for things like villain "flashbacks" and contingency plans, and also to escape.  

## Transitions

common transition activities. Healing rolls, relationship rolls, gather info. Other stuff, gathering new resources. 

## Making Heroes

7 action dots. Max 2 to start. 
7 threat of powers. Max power 3. 
  Each powerset must have 1 limit, but can have more for extra threat. 
  1 threat for a Sfx.
1 Ability. <!-- todo - can we trade threat for abilities? or vice versa? Also, abilities? -->
3 dots of relationships, 1 must be an NPC. Also they are symmetric, so if you choose someone and they also choose you, you both get a 2. 
 




## Superpowers
<!-- 
lets take a shot at cortex powers in shift-x. It's almost a direct translation. 
actions and reactions become actions and resists.

the 1 to 4 scale translates pretty well though I think the shift-x scale might got a ways beyond 4. Maybe we can talk about what the scale for various powers might be. 

Recovering Shutdown powers: Wait for a transition scene, may or may not cost. Take an appropriate action to recover during an action sequence. Might be able to recover if you crit on an action. -->


Heroes have powers and the powers heroes have are part of a narrative construct called a powerset. 

### Powersets

Each powerset is a thematic grouping of powers which have the origin and the same drawbacks. 

There's no particular restriction on the number of powers a powerset can contain but each the powers have to share the same narrative origin. 

Each powerset must have at least 1 limit which, following from the shared origin of the powers, indicates some drawback or way these powers can be **shutdown**. 

Each powerset may contain one or more **sfx** which are special things your powers can do and unless otherwise stated apply to every power in the set. 

Besides shared origin and narrative consistance, there is a mechanical advantage to having more the one powerset, because by default you can use one power from each powerset for a particular action.


### Powers

The following is a list og generic powers you can take. The powerset, and the name you pick for the power will fill in the fiction of the power.

#### Attack

Blasts, claws, weapons, punches.

#### Durability

#### Elemental Control

#### Intangibility

#### Invisibility

#### Movement

#### Psychic 

These are a more interesting category, There's mind control and telepathy. Both have their scales and their effects. In C+ they are used to create complications. 

#### Reflexes

Simlar to movement powers but not quite the same. Very come and can be used for actions or resistance. But obviously you have to be able to see it coming. 

Maybe change acrobatics back to Finesse? 

#### Resistance

You are resistant to some kind of harm most people are normally not. Mystic or Psychic. Mmm...

#### Senses

Tons of different possibilities here. Can help with actions, resists or gather info. 

#### Shapeshifting

Also generally useful. 

#### Size Changing

Grow or shrink, tend to come associated with other powers and some specific limits 

#### Sorcery

Or cosmic force, not sure exactly about this one yet.

#### Stamina

in c+ this one is mostly about recovery. Or resisting toxins and diseases and such. Totally can serve the same purpose 

#### Strength 

Good one for actions, specially wreak. 

#### Stretching

mmmm...stretching. So, this could be 

#### Teleport

Bamf!

#### Transmutation

I guess it's a thing. Might be constructs is a better word?

### Special Effects (sfx)

Things that can increase or decrease the threat of powers is commonly a sfx.

#### Absorption 

When you resist a [type of attack] you can create a stunt using the avoided consequence or add it equally to all the powers in your set, for the rest of scene. 

#### Afflict 

Increased effect when you inflict [type of consequence]. Maybe also add +1d?

#### Area of Effect

Either you have increased effect on the magnitude table for size, or just your powers have AOE. Collateral damage can be a thing with these powers though. 

#### Berserk

Add a die to the villainy pool for +1 effect. 

#### Boost

Shutdown a power and increase the threat of another by +1. 

#### Burst

Add +1d against a single target but with reduced effect.

#### Constructs

Increased effect for stunts. 

#### Counterattack

When you resist stuff, you can turn it into an attack. 

#### Dangerous

Move your action towards desparate for increased effect.

#### Focus 

a thing?

#### Healing

+1d to treatment rolls for [type of harm].

#### Immunity

Spend 1 stress to avoid [type of consequence].

#### Multipower

Include more than one power from the same set in an action at -1 threat to each.

#### Second Chance

spend 1 stress to reroll an action?

#### Second Wind 

mmmm

#### Unleashed

Inflict a consequence and increase the threat of a power by the same.

### Limits

Every powerset has at least one.

#### Conscious Activation

Shutdown powerset when you are not conscious, or at 3 harm. 

#### Exhausted

So what if instead of getting a PP you can shutdown a power like armor?

#### Gear

Shutdown a power for an armor effect. Recover by taking an action or transition scene. 

#### Growing Dread

Your powers make stuff worse. Maybe, risky is the best position you can have when using this powerset.

#### Mutant

Just one source of powers. 

#### Mutually Exclusive 

Makes two powersets mutually exclusive. Shutdown one to activate the other. maybe be worth 2 limits?

#### Uncontrollable

Change a power into a complication and shut it down. This one is almost worth 2 in the blades world. 

## Gear

Almost every superteam has some kind of standard gear, even if that's just communcation equipment. 

Some characters can build and modify gear too. 

Vehicles tends to count as gear most of the time. So, maybe we can say that gear is more of a team thing? Like, the team gets a **load** and they can spend it to have various things like a vehicle as part of the scene, or some other advanced tech. That's good then I can imagine tech focused teams might have an ability that gives them increased **load** or reduces the cost of equipment. 

Is load the right word for it? Resources, Tech, Backup, Support? Could be that this spendable resource includes all manner of external help and backup the team might get? Like, extra personnel to do lab work. 

Don't want to get too abstract. that way lies some madness let me tell you. Extra personnel and backup are not gear and if you have them available, it's because of a specific ability the team took. 

Yuppssss. Time to starting working on the team biznatch.
