# Quickstart

For players already familar with *Blades in the Dark*, this quickstart summerizes how *Shift-X* is different.

## Structure of a Game

A *Shift-X* session may start with downtime activities and free play just like a *Blades* game, but rather than the crew picking a score and making an engagement roll, the GM will pick a moment to interrupt the heroes's lives with some villain's evil plans. 

### Action Sequences

The central unit of cinematic play in *Shift-X* is the action sequence. 
<!-- need to describe an action sequence a little more. espeically how it represents some part of the villain's plan. -->
Thwarting a villain involves an escalating series of action sequences connected by a transition period where heroes can risk taking time to gather info or recover stress before the next action sequence. 

### Villain Pressure

While there is some room for scenes between action sequences there's no time to rest becuase it's the villain and their plan that drives *Shift-X*. If the heroes take too long the It's the villain that makes


## Powers

### SFX 

By dfault powers have limitations, but special effects

### Stunts

Heros have a whole extra way to push themselves and that is with stunts. Stunts are basically any way of using your powerset that it doens't currently allow, but fits narratively. This could be adding a new power temporaraly, or changing how an existing power works. Stunts typically last for a scene. Which may, or may not, corrispond to a current action sequence.

#### Attack

Attack powers represent some kind of attack a character can make either ranged or close quarters.  
It can be a physical attack, which is the most common. Physical attacks increase the effect of an action, usually a Fight action and, depending on the description of the power, might lend their effect to Wreck as well. 
<!-- Default is Fight only, there is a special effect for Wreck AND Fight. Are there some attacks that are directed by other actions? Like is there a power that adds its effect to a Spy action? like a secret device? Also, for an sfx you get potency against groups. Which means something like, no reduced effect against a group for AOE  
Or is is flexible like control is. Apply your threat against the magnitude tables when you need to fight multiple targets. 
-->

Attacks can also be psychic in nature and lend their effect to, most commonly, a Menace action. 

#### Defense

For a defense power, pick an attribute and a general kind of consequence that it will lend it's threat against those. Defenses can be armor, reflexes, predictive insight. Generally, a defense will only apply to a particular attribute.  

#### Movement

Movement powers grant a character either new forms of movement such as flying or swinging, or increased effect for an existing form of movement such as superhuman running. Movement powers generally use a Move action, but can optionally use another action such as Acrobatics.  

#### Gather Information

There's a vast array of sensory and knowledge powers who's primary purpose is to provide new and unique ways to gather information. Pick one action this power works with. 

#### Control

Control grants influence over some narrative element. You can "spend" your threat on the magnitude table to assemble the effect of your power. You can spend stess to make up the different if you effect is larger than the threat of your power. 


## Making Heroes

7 action dots. Max 2 to start. 
7 threat of powers. Max 3.
1 Ability.

<!-- So, 1 ability is pretty close to 1 threat worth of powers, so possibly, you could trade 1 threat worth of powers for another ability. Or vice versa?  -->
