# Quickstart

For players already familiar with *Blades in the Dark*, this quickstart summarizes how *Shift-X* is different.

## Structure of a Game

A *Shift-X* session may start with downtime activities and free play just like a *Blades* game, but rather than the crew picking a score and making an engagement roll, the GM will pick a moment to interrupt the heroes' lives with a villain's evil plans. 

### Action Sequences

The central unit of cinematic play in *Shift-X* is the action sequence. It's one, or more, scenes of action and conflict where the heroes attempt to interfere with some part of the villain's plan.

An action sequence kicks off with the GM making an engagement roll on behalf of the villain to see how well this stage of their plan is going when the action starts. Do the heroes arrive just in the nick of time? (**4/5**), or do they get the drop on the unfortunate mastermind (**1-3**)?

GM Note: It's best to make the engagement roll early, even before the transition activities are done because the engagement roll can have strong affect on the next action sequence. It could make the different between fighting an army of the villain's minions or ambushing the villain alone. 

Thwarting a villain involves an escalating series of action sequences connected by a transition period where heroes can risk taking time to gather info or recover stress before the next action sequence. 

### Transition Activities

Between action sequences is a period of transition where heroes often travel to new locations and have the chance to do things like recover stress or gather information. However, the more transition activities the team pursues, the more dice the GM will add to the villain's next engagement roll. This is the driving tension of *Shift-X* and is quite different from the slowly building tension of *Blades in the Dark*.

## Powers

section for powers and powersets, their basic structure. Name, threat, description. Limits. 

A bit about how you use powers and what might happen when you do.

### Stunts

Heroes have a whole extra way to push themselves and that is with stunts. Stunts are basically any way of using your powerset that it doesn't currently allow, but fits narratively. This could be adding a new power temporarily, or changing how an existing power works. Stunts typically last for a scene. Which may, or may not, correspond to a current action sequence.  

## Into the Action

This is a section for taking actions and how powers affect that, and also additional complications that can occur, namely, adding engagement dice. And powers getting overtaxed or shutdown. 


### Using Powers

A power can be used with either an action or a resist. When you use a power you increase the effect of action by the threat of the power, or reduce the level of harm taken by the threat of your power. 

Even if your power reduces potential harm to 0 or less, you are still rolling a resist and still have to spend the stress. 

Using a power is optional, unless some kind of complication is in play, because whenever you activate a power you give the GM an opportunity to introduce additional complications based on your power and its threat. 

Using a power can make your actions much more effective, but you risk equally more serious complications. 

Also want to know about the GM spending villainy dice for things like villain "flashbacks" and contingency plans, and also to escape.  

## Transitions

common transition activities. Healing rolls, relationship rolls, gather info. Other stuff, gathering new resources. 

## Making Heroes

7 action dots. Max 2 to start. 
7 threat of powers. Max power 3. 
  Each powerset must have 1 limit, but can have more for extra threat. 
  1 threat for a Sfx.
1 Ability. <!-- todo - can we trade threat for abilities? or vice versa? -->
3 dots of relationships, 1 must be an NPC. Also they are symmetric, so if you choose someone and they also choose you, you both start with a 2. 

## Superpowers
<!-- 
lets take a shot at cortex powers in shift-x. It's almost a direct translation. 
actions and reactions become actions and resists.

the 1 to 4 scale translates pretty well though I think the shift-x scale might got a ways beyond 4. Maybe we can talk about what the scale for various powers might be. 

Recovering Shutdown powers: Wait for a transition scene, may or may not cost. Take an appropriate action to recover during an action sequence. Might be able to recover if you crit on an action.
back to a particular question...do powers add to, or replace the default effect of actions/resists? I should try it both ways. 
-->

Heroes have powers and the powers heroes have are part of a narrative construct called a powerset. 

### Powersets

Each powerset is a thematic grouping of powers which have the origin and the same drawbacks. 

There's no particular restriction on the number of powers a powerset can contain but each the powers have to share the same narrative origin. 

Each powerset must have at least 1 limit which, following from the shared origin of the powers, indicates some drawback or way these powers can be **shutdown**. 

Each powerset may contain one or more **sfx** which are special things your powers can do and unless otherwise stated apply to every power in the set. 

Besides shared origin and narrative consistance, there is a mechanical advantage to having more the one powerset; by default you can use one power from each powerset for a particular action.

### Powers

The following is a list of generic powers you can take. The powerset, and the name you pick for the power will fill in the fiction of the power.

#### Attack

Blasts, claws, weapons, punches. Most commonly use with Fight actions, but some powers also lend themselves to Wreak or Acrobatic actions. 

#### Durability

There are many many forms of being hard to harm. Works with Prowess resists against appropriate narrative harm. 



Depending on the narrative particulars of a specific kind of harm vs a specific durability power the GM may judge the durability to have reduced effect, or even no effect.

#### Elemental Control

#### Intangibility

#### Invisibility

#### Movement

#### Psychic 

These are a more interesting category, There's mind control and telepathy. Both have their scales and their effects. In C+ they are used to create complications. 

#### Reflexes

Simlar to movement powers but not quite the same. Very come and can be used for actions or resistance. But obviously you have to be able to see it coming. 

Maybe change acrobatics back to Finesse? 

#### Resistance

You are resistant to some kind of harm most people are normally not. Mystic or Psychic. Mmm...

#### Senses

Tons of different possibilities here. Can help with actions, resists or gather info. 

#### Shapeshifting

Also generally useful. 

#### Size Changing

Grow or shrink, tend to come associated with other powers and some specific limits 

#### Sorcery

Or cosmic force, not sure exactly about this one yet.

#### Stamina

in c+ this one is mostly about recovery. Or resisting toxins and diseases and such. Totally can serve the same purpose 

#### Strength 

Good one for actions, specially wreak. 

#### Stretching

mmmm...stretching. So, this could be 

#### Teleport

Bamf!

#### Transmutation

I guess it's a thing. Might be constructs is a better word?

### Special Effects (sfx)

Things that can increase or decrease the threat of powers is commonly a sfx.

#### Absorption 

When you resist a [type of attack] you can create a stunt using the avoided consequence or add it equally to all the powers in your set, for the rest of scene. 

#### Afflict 

Increased effect when you inflict [type of consequence]. Maybe also add +1d?

#### Area of Effect

Either you have increased effect on the magnitude table for size, or just your powers have AOE. Collateral damage can be a thing with these powers though. 

#### Berserk

Add a die to the villainy pool for +1 effect. 

#### Boost

Shutdown a power and increase the threat of another by +1. 

#### Burst

Add +1d against a single target but with reduced effect.

#### Constructs

Increased effect for stunts. 

#### Counterattack

When you resist stuff, you can turn it into an attack. 

#### Dangerous

Move your action towards desparate for increased effect.

#### Focus 

a thing?

#### Healing

+1d to treatment rolls for [type of harm].

#### Immunity

Spend 1 stress to avoid [type of consequence].

#### Multipower

Include more than one power from the same set in an action at -1 threat to each.

#### Second Chance

spend 1 stress to reroll an action?

#### Second Wind 

mmmm

#### Unleashed

Inflict a consequence and increase the threat of a power by the same.

### Limits

Every powerset has at least one.

#### Conscious Activation

Shutdown powerset when you are not conscious, or at 3 harm. 

#### Exhausted

So what if instead of getting a PP you can shutdown a power like armor?

#### Gear

Shutdown a power for an armor effect. Recover by taking an action or transition scene. 

#### Growing Dread

Your powers make stuff worse. Maybe, risky is the best position you can have when using this powerset.

#### Mutant

Just one source of powers. 

#### Mutually Exclusive 

Makes two powersets mutually exclusive. Shutdown one to activate the other. You can take this on each of the affected powersets.

#### Uncontrollable

Change a power into a complication and shut it down. This one is almost worth 2 in the blades world. 

## Teams

The heart of *Shift-X* is the team of heroes. 

Big question, do teams have a tier, and if so, how does it advance? we know what it means more or less, the quality of things like gear and cohorts. 


## Gear

Almost every superteam has some kind of standard gear, even if that's just communcation equipment. 

Some characters can build and modify gear too. 

Vehicles tends to count as gear most of the time. So, maybe we can say that gear is more of a team thing? Like, the team gets a **load** and they can spend it to have various things like a vehicle as part of the scene, or some other advanced tech. That's good then I can imagine tech focused teams might have an ability that gives them increased **load** or reduces the cost of equipment. 

Is load the right word for it? Resources, Tech, Backup, Support? Could be that this spendable resource includes all manner of external help and backup the team might get? Like, extra personnel to do lab work. 

Don't want to get too abstract. that way lies some madness let me tell you. Extra personnel and backup are not gear and if you have them available, it's because of a specific ability the team took. 

Yuppssss. Time to starting working on the team biznatch. 

## Downtime

### Projects

Project clocks can do all kinds of things. Could be building things, gathering info.

### Training

Another common one for heroes. Mark an xp for an attribute or a powerset by intense training.

### Solo Issue

Many superheroes have solo adventures. This is a good default downtime activity for heroes. Make some kind of roll, or maybe three. Maybe the position is set by what kind of solo thing it is. From dealing with simple robbers (controlled), to the culmination of a personal mission, (Desperate). The roll is maybe your best action? or a fortune roll based on how prepared you are? if you fail you get to roll again with a worse position, unless of course it's already desperate. Could be you roll your best attribute. 

You get some fair number of experience for a solo issue, like 3 xp, but there is the possiblity you'll be stuck with consequences at the start of the next team issue. 


Details to know: who the villain is and their plan; what your approach is; roll to see how it goes; optionally, specify a continuity detail from your solo issue that affects the rest of the game. Like, you recruit a new hero to the team, or for big stuff, take out a faction. 

Steve Rogers at the end of winter solider, a solo issue, ends up with a psychological issue around Bucky, which is then exploited at the start of civil war. Just a minor one, but it's enough. 

So, are solo issues unrelated to the overall team narrative? could you use them to accomplish some team goal? 


So, alternately, the solo issue is 1-4 xp depending on consequences, players choice generally, also says how big a continuity thing you can declare. Then you just resist that consequence? 
Like, an entire mission as a resistance roll. That is interesting. 


## Action

for every event, the team can earn or loose a positive rep? maybe have to deal with some fallout from their mission? maybe not as complex as blades, just a simple sliding scale.
