# Quickstart

For players already familiar with *Blades in the Dark*, this quickstart summarizes how *Shift-X* is different.

## Structure of a Game

A *Shift-X* session may start with downtime activities and free play just like a *Blades* game, but rather than the crew picking a score and making an engagement roll, the GM will pick a moment to interrupt the heroes' lives with a villain's evil plans. 

### Action Sequences

The central unit of cinematic play in *Shift-X* is the action sequence. It's one, or more, scenes of action and conflict where the heroes attempt to interfere with some part of the villain's plan.

An action sequence kicks off with the GM making an engagement roll on behalf of the villain to see how well this stage of their plan is going when the action starts. Do the heroes arrive just in the nick of time? (**4/5**), or do they get the drop on the unfortunate mastermind (**1-3**)?

GM Note: It's best to make the engagement roll early, even before the transition activities are done because the engagement roll can have strong affect on the next action sequence. It could make the different between fighting an army of the villain's minions or ambushing the villain alone. 

Thwarting a villain involves an escalating series of action sequences connected by a transition period where heroes can risk taking time to gather info or recover stress before the next action sequence. 

### Transition Activities

Between action sequences is a period of transition where heroes often travel to new locations and have the chance to do things like recover stress or gather information. However, the more transition activities the team pursues, the more dice the GM will add to the villain's next engagement roll. This is the driving tension of *Shift-X* and is quite different from the slowly building tension of *Blades in the Dark*.

## Powers

section for powers and powersets, their basic structure. Name, threat, description. Limits. 

A bit about how you use powers and what might happen when you do.

### SFX 

By default powers have limitations, but special effects

### Stunts

Heroes have a whole extra way to push themselves and that is with stunts. Stunts are basically any way of using your powerset that it doesn't currently allow, but fits narratively. This could be adding a new power temporarily, or changing how an existing power works. Stunts typically last for a scene. Which may, or may not, correspond to a current action sequence.  

## Into the Action

This is a section for taking actions and how powers affect that, and also additional complications that can occur, namely, adding engagement dice. And powers getting overtaxed or shutdown. 

Also want to know about the GM spending villainy dice for things like villain "flashbacks" and contingency plans, and also to escape.  

## Transitions

common transition activities. Healing rolls, relationship rolls, gather info. Other stuff, gathering new resources. 

## Making Heroes

7 action dots. Max 2 to start. 
7 threat of powers. Max 3.
1 Ability.
3 dots of relationships, 1 must be an NPC. Also they are symmetric, so if you choose someone and they also choose you, you both get a 2.

CUrrent power categories are more abstract than these. That could be kinda an issue for somethings because you get caught up in what is the right way to describe a power discussions. Also, what about sfx? there is some room for them, maybe. Like, add an extra option, I think I did that for the Powerfist. The fist works for fight or wreck, which makes sense, but here is the thing... does it make any sense to limit powers to a specific action? or a specific attrribute for that matter? 
DOes that break the fiction-first nature of the game? I think so. 
Which means, some powers you can obviously use for fighting and wrecking, or fighting and move like iron man's repulsors. You just have to accept any consequences you might run into. 
Which is fine, means we have to describe powers well. 

for example, it just makes sense that you could roll acrobatics when using a move power based on swinging. 


So, here is another issue from iron man, what about the giant chest beam, the attack power you only use once. or so, is that a stunt? similar question, why ever take more than one attack power? If you break it down, do superheroes ever really have more than one attack power? or are their attacks just some flavor of the same powers? And, if someone did take two attack powers...what

#### Attack

Attack powers represent some kind of attack a character can make either ranged or close quarters.  
It can be a physical attack, which is the most common. Physical attacks increase the effect of an action, usually a Fight action and, depending on the description of the power, might lend their effect to Wreck as well. 

Pick an action and 
<!-- Default is Fight only, there is a special effect for Wreck AND Fight. Are there some attacks that are directed by other actions? Like is there a power that adds its effect to a Spy action? like a secret device? Also, for an sfx you get potency against groups. Which means something like, no reduced effect against a group for AOE  
Or is is flexible like control is. Apply your threat against the magnitude tables when you need to fight multiple targets. 
-->

Attacks can also be psychic in nature and lend their effect to, most commonly, a Menace action. 

#### Defense

Defense powers are very common. They provide a hero the ability to resist even fatal consequences. When you take a defense power, pick an attribute and a common type of damage or consequence you can resist. When you resist a consequence without a power you normally reduce it's severity by 1, but when you use a power to resist a consequence you can reduce it by 1+(threat of your defense power). this makes it more common for you to entirely avoid consequences. 

Also, when you use a defense power you might avoid the consequence entirely but trade it in for a suitably reduced consequence of a very different type based upon the limits of your powerset.

Some resist powers grant you the ability to resist consequences with a different attribute.

Some common examples:
> Body Armor - resists physical attacks with Prowess. notably small arms, punches, and perhaps lasers. Doesn't usually work as well more elemental attacks like fire, lightning, poison and such.
> Toughness - Like armor but your body is especially resilient. Resist physical consequences with Prowess. Also not generally as good against elemental harm.
> Force Field - You can create force fields from your will. Resist physical consequences with Resolve. You have to be aware of the harm to use this power.  
> Resist Fire - You can resist harm from fire and heat with Prowess. So, for more limited powers like this, do you get increased effect. You can 
> Precognition - If you are aware of a physical consequence you can resist it with Insight.
> Reflexes - You can dodge lots of consequences with your amazing reflexes. You have to be aware of the consequence. 

#### Resist

Resist powers work against a specific uncommon kind of consequence. Such as heat and fire, or cold, or psychic attacks, or being conned or lied to. Because these powers are generally less applicable, they reduce the severity of consequences by the power's threat BEFORE you need to roll to resist. In this way a resist power allows you to ignore consequences that do not exceed your threat. If a consequence is greater then your power you resist the overage normally if you wish.

Question is, can you take a power that resists physical attacks? Like, lasers, or hand to hand attacks? 

> Born on a Fire Planet - Reduce incoming heat and fire-based consequences. 
> Iron Shirt - By focusing your chi you can reduce the level incoming hand to hand attacks. 

#### Movement

Movement powers grant a character either new forms of movement such as flying or swinging, or increased effect for an existing form of movement such as superhuman running. Movement powers generally use a Move action, but can optionally use another action such as Acrobatics.



#### Gather Information

There's a vast array of sensory and knowledge powers who's primary purpose is to provide new and unique ways to gather information. Pick one action this power works with. 

#### Control

Control grants influence over some narrative element. You can "spend" your threat on the magnitude table to assemble the effect of your power. You can spend stress to make up the different if you effect is larger than the threat of your power. 



<!-- So, 1 ability is pretty close to 1 threat worth of powers, so possibly, you could trade 1 threat worth of powers for another ability. Or vice versa?  -->
